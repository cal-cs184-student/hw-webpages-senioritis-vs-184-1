		<h2>Overview</h2>
		In Homework 1, we implemented a simple vector graphics renderer that can draw triangles, supersample, transform, and texture map.

		<h2>Task 1: Drawing Single-Color Triangles</h2>
		<!--
			<img src="lion.jpg" width="400px"/>
		-->
		I rasterize triangles by iterating over its surrounding box, checking each point for whether it meets the three-line test requirement (either all &le; 0 or all &ge; 0 to account for the two possible winding orders). Finally, if the three-line test condition is met, the pixel in the sample buffer is filled with the color passed in as an argument.

		In my implementation, I calculate the max and min of the passed in vertex coordinates, which form a tight box around the triangle. I then only iterate within these bounds. Since I calculate the bounding box directly in my code, my algorithm by definition is no worse than one that checks each sample within the bounding box of the triangle.

		<b>Extra Credit:</b>
		Optimizations:

		Unoptimized implementation: 0.001418s

		Redundant arithmetic operations factored out: 0.001011s

		Now that I look at my implementation, I may have included minimal memory accesses by default (the minimal amount of accesses is to fill pixels a number of times equal to the number of pixels in the triangle). My code already does this rather than filling with white in the "three line test failed" case.
		
		<h2>Task 2: Antialiasing by Supersampling</h2>
		In my supersampling algorithm, rather than iterating over entire pixels at once, I iterate over the subpixels and color in the corresponding subpixel in the sample buffer if the three line test condition is met. Afterwards, when resolving to framebuffer, I iterate over each pixel's subpixels and average
		the colors of each subpixel to obtain the overall pixel's color. Finally, the color is converted from the sample buffer's format to the format expected by the rgb frame buffer.
		Supersampling is useful because standard sampling could lead to aliasing in the output image (e.g. jaggies, broken tips), which can be unpleasant or confusing to the user.
		To implement supersampling, I had to adjust all references to the sample buffer to incorporate the sample rate, as each cell has to be referred to with an integer value.
		In addition to the modifications to the loops mentioned previously, I added the averaging portion of supersampling into resolve_to_framebuffer, so averaging is automatically done when the method is called.
		Supersampling allows for "blurring" of images, making features such as jaggies and broken tips less prominent. For example, a red triangle with jaggies will have its edges blurred with lighter reds by supersampling, making the jaggies less prominent.

		As sample rate goes up, the detached corner appears to "reattach" itself to the triangle when viewed with the naked eye, though it is still somewhat detached in the pixel viewer.
		This happens because supersampling blurring allows intermediate shades of red to be populated in the pixels between the vertex and the rest of the triangle, thus causing the viewer to see that the vertex is now attached to the rest of the triangle.
		<br>
		<b>Extra Credit:</b> I implemented jitter sampling. Rather than always sampling from the middle of the pixel, I randomly generate an x and y offset, which I use to get the sample. This method of sampling is still heavily grid-based, but introduces randomness.

		<h2>Task 4: Barycentric coordinates</h2>

		Barycentric coordinates allow us to interpolate positions or values within a triangle using a linear combination of three known positions or values.
		The vertices of the triangles are used to calculate weights for the three known values. Here's an image of a triangle with one red, one green, and one blue vertex:

		<figure>
			<img src="task4triangle.png" alt="color interpolated triangle" style="width:50%"/>
			<figcaption>Triangle with one red, one green, and one blue corner.</figcaption>
		</figure>

		Notice in the triangle above that only the vertices themselves start out with colors. We use barycentric coordinates to combine the colors of these vertices according
		to some calculated weights to determine what color each point in the triangle should be.

		<h2>Task 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h2>
		Pixel sampling is the selection of pixels from an image to represent the image. To perform texture mapping, I first use the pixel's coordinates to generate alpha, beta, and gamma values.
		If the sampled point from the pixel meets the three line test requirement, these calculated values are used with the u, v values corresponding to each of the triangle's vertices
		to generate a sampled color for the sample buffer. Two types of sampling are supported: nearest sampling and bilinear sampling. In nearest sampling, the sampled color is that of the texture pixel closest to the provided u,v values.
		Bilinear sampling looks for the four texture pixels closest to the provided u,v values and uses them to perform multiple linear interpolations, after which the resulting texture pixel color is returned.

		<p>Here are the screenshots of texmap/test6.svg with pixel viewer centered on one of the Campanile's clock faces.</p>

		It's a little hard to tell from the shrunk screenshots but in this area of high color contrast, the hands of the clock are a little more "blurred" in the bilinear images vs the nearest images.
		When viewed in the pixel viewer, the end of the minutes hand is a bit detached from the rest of the arm in the nearest screenshots whereas it is almost blurred back together in the bilinear sampling images.
		Additionally, the darker lines of the Campanile are more jagged in the nearest sampling images. This does allow for better representation of the numbers on the clock face, however.
		There isn't very much difference between the sample rate 1 and sample rate 16 images, except for a handful of pixels that change color for greater blurring effect.

		There will be a large difference between nearest and bilinear sampling in images with very thin, high color contrast details similar to the Campanile example above.
		This happens because nearest sampling only takes the texture color of its one closest neighbor whereas bilinear is able to use the four closest pixels on top of linear interpolation, which enhances its ability to produce intermediate colors.
		It's similar to supersampling, where the more samples you take per pixel, the better the blurring.

		<h2>Task 6: "Level Sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h2>
		Level sampling is similar to the sampling mentioned in Task 5, except instead of always sampling textures from the original, full resolution texture, we sample textures from various mipmap levels.
		This was implemented for texture mapping determining which level the passed in partial derivatives corresponded to according to a mathematical formula. Then, when performing nearest or bilinear sampling, this calculated level would be used to determine which mipmap level to obtain a texture pixel color from.

		<p>Here are the screenshots of my png on texmap/test5.svg with various combinations of sampling and levels.</p>

		Notice the difference in jaggies and blurring of the gradient wingtip.
